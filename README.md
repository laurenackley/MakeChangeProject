# Make Change Project - Skill Distillery Week 1 Homework

### Description
Cash register! It will ask you the cost of an item and how the amount that you will pay with. If you give **less** than it cost, it will give you an error.  If you give the exact amount, it will say it was exact change and thank you. If you give a larger amount than the cost of the item, then it will break down how much you owe in the largest denomination possible.
### Lessons Learned
Pseudocode is important. Like an outline for an essay, it will help keep you focused.
I found the Oracle docs that explained Math.round which was extremely helpful! I found a way to do it on StackOverflow that was much clunkier.. but using multiple resources and cross checking was fun.
I also learned that if you get stuck, maybe walking away and coming back with
fresh eyes is a good idea.  I also learned that if you get stuck and aren't show what the variable amount is to use System.out.println(variable); and it will tell you what it was so you can maybe tell what the error was better than guessing.  I kept getting stuck on certain parts of the code and was really confused on what I was doing wrong. I would start a new class and try it a different way and it helped me find different ways to approach the problem.
